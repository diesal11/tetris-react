# Tetris React

The classic Tetris, built in Typescript & React.

When i was first learning to code I built a Tetris clone in Java, since then whenever i learn a new language or framework I try to build a Tetris clone to nail the basics.

This is far from the first React project I've built, but i wanted to try out React 19 + Compiler, and see how it compares to the old `useMemo` based approach.

It's ended up being a nice example of how i approach building a React app, so i've made it public.
